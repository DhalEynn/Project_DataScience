# Project Datascience.

This is a repository for the works done in collaboration with another student in our three years of engineer school (Polytech) about datasciences.

## PROJ632, the first year :

### Project one : DataTourism.

This is a project where we have to use the platform "DataTourisme" to find tourism provider in the 73 and 74 French departments and export it in CSV format.

### Project two : Open Food Facts.

Make a list of all the products which the client is not allergic to on the Open Food Facts platform.
